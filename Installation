    Obtain litepresence python script for Extinction Event and microDEX from official source:

    https://github.com/litepresence/extinction-event/blob/master/microDEX/microDEX.py
    https://github.com/litepresence/extinction-event/blob/master/EV/EV.py

    In Github press raw button and then do select all and copy.  
    Paste it in a text editor and save as microDEX.py and EV.py respectively.
    Save it into a folder you want to use for trading.  
    You will be changing into that directory to run the script.

    These are stand alone python scripts.  You do not need to clone my repos, though you are welcome to do so. 
    Extinction Event is an algo trading bot framework including backtest and live session engine.
    microDEX is a live orderbook, chart, and UI for manual trading
    You can learn more about both by visiting bitsharestalk General Forum.
    I also have Elitist Bred Quantum Particle Swarm tuned algorithms for sale in the forum.

    Visit litepresence.com to learn more.

    Read scripts before you put passwords in; take personal responsibility!
    If you don't and I am scammer I take your funds quick and easy.  

    Extinction Event and microDEX are BLEEDING EDGE TECHNOLOGY in active DEVELOPMENT. 
    These are alpha release to public domain without warranty.  

    READ THE CODE - Check litepresence github regularly for latest version.
