# extinction-event
cryptocurrency algo trading tools


The repo name "Extinction Event" was born of the notion that DEX tech combined with AI controlled algo trading tech reaching the common user, in unison, would be an extinction level event for centralized web based exchanges, intrusive state AML/KYC policies, and orchestrated pump and dump schemes; all of which I consider anathema to individual financial liberty and decentralized free market economy.
